# Book Bestsellers Dashboard
Link: https://final-9z9h.onrender.com/

Dashboard Description:
The dashboard shows bestsellers from 2009 to 2019. The interactive dashboard allows you to filter books by year range and genre. You can discover correlations between user ratings, reviews, and prices. This dashboard is perfect for book enthusiasts, publishers, and anyone interested in understanding trends in literature. Motivated by a desire to uncover patterns in reading trends, I built this dashboard to make complex data accessible as it can be hard to have a lot of data on books across different authors and genres in one place.

Dashboard Building Process:
My dashboard aims to provide insights into book trends using data from Kaggle. To achieve this, I employed various data science concepts such as data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis.
First, I cleaned the dataset, removing missing values and ensuring data consistency. Next, I created interactive visualizations using Plotly and Dash, enabling users to explore trends over time. I utilized a RangeSlider and Checklist components to allow users to filter books based on year range and genre.
Furthermore, I analyzed correlations between user ratings, reviews, and prices, visualizing these relationships using bar charts, scatter plots, and line charts. I learned about callback functions and how to enhance the visual look of such graphs.

Strengths and learning experiences:
While building this dashboard, I strengthened my skills in data visualization, data manipulation, and web development too (with HTML and CSS). I gained hands-on experience in building interactive dashboards and learned how to present complex data in a user-friendly format.
Overall, this project was a great learning experience, allowing me to combine my passion for literature with my data science skills. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects and roles.
